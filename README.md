NEST Desktop is a graphical user interface for [NEST Simulator](https://nest-simulator.org). With this easy-to-use tool, users can interactively construct neuronal networks and explore network dynamics.
The AppImage is a stand-alone application build with Electron framework.

Advanced users often choose NEST Simulator: a prominent tool for spiking neuronal networks to measure network dynamics.
However, programming knowledge is required to write code for this tool.
NEST Desktop bypasses this requirement, but still teaches users how to construct and explore neuronal networks.
A textual script is generated from the constructed networks and sent to NEST Simulator;
the network activity is then visualized in a graph or table.
It is a useful teaching tool, since the network graphs and network activity visualizations can be exported to files that users can implement for their course protocol.

NEST Desktop is available on [EBRAINS](https://ebrains.eu/service/nest-desktop) (free EBRAINS account required).

### Quick start

To get started with NEST Desktop and NEST Simulator, click on an AppImage file downloaded from the release.

> | :information_source: **Info** |
> | ----------------------------- |
>
> NEST Simulator (v3.0 or higher) should be installed and the command (`nest-server`) callable in the terminal. The AppImage starts nest-server before opening the window.
